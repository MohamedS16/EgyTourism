                    <p>Alan Muntz, chairman of Airwork, visited Egypt in 1931; at that time, he expressed his intention
                        of starting up a new airline in the country. The new enterprise was named Misr Airwork, with
                        ″Misr″ being Arabic for Egypt. On 31 December 1931, the government granted the new company the
                        exclusivity of air transport operations. A division of Misr Airwork named Misr Airlines was
                        established on 7 June 1932, ″to promote the spirit of aviation among Egyptian youth″, becoming
                        the seventh carrier in the world. The headquarters of Misr Airwork, S.A.E. was in Almaza
                        Aerodrome, Heliopolis, Cairo. </p>
